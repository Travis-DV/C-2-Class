Question 1:
Write a query selecting all records from the address table located in the 
state of Missouri.

SELECT Address1 
FROM Address 
WHERE State = "Missouri";


Question 2:
Write a query totaling all of the invoices in the invoice table that
were dated 2022.

SELECT Sum(InvoiceAmount) AS Total 
FROM Invoice 
WHERE YEAR(InvoiceDate) = 2022;


Question 3:
Write a query listing all of the Customers table data ordered by phone
number in descending order

SELECT *
FROM Customer
ORDER BY Phone DESC;


Question 4:
Write a query totalling all of the invoices in the Invoice table where
the customer's zipcode is 63101 (this will require one JOIN to the 
Customer table; see Figure 19-8 in the text for examples of INNER JOIN
and another JOIN from Customer Address)

SELECT Sum(InvoiceAmount) AS Total
FROM Invoice
INNER JOIN Customer ON Invoice.CustomerID = Customer.CustomerID
INNER JOIN Address ON Customer.AddressID = Address.AddressID
WHERE Address.ZipCode = '63101';


Question 5:
Write a query counting the number of invoices in the Invoice table
where the address has a state of Illinois.
(This will require TWO JOIN statements.  See my Overview of this module
in Canvas for an example of two joins)

SELECT Count(*) AS Total
FROM Invoice
INNER JOIN Customer ON Invoice.CustomerID = Customer.CustomerID
INNER JOIN Address ON Customer.AddressID = Address.AddressID
WHERE Address.State = 'Illinois';
